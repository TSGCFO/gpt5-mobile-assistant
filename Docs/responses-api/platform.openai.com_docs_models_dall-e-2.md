Image

DALL·E is an AI system that creates realistic images and art from a natural language description. Older than DALL·E 3, DALL·E 2 offers more control in prompting and more requests at once.

Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there's a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| Free | Not supported |
| Tier 1 | 500 img/min |
| Tier 2 | 2500 img/min |
