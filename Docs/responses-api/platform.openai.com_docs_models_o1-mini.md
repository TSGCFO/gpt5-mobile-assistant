The o1 reasoning model is designed to solve hard problems across domains. o1-mini is a faster and more affordable reasoning model, but we recommend using the newer o3-mini model that features higher intelligence at the same latency and price as o1-mini.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
