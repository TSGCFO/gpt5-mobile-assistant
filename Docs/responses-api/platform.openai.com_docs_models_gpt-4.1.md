GPT-4.1 excels at instruction following and tool calling, with broad
knowledge across domains. It features a 1M token context window, and
low latency without a reasoning step.

Note that we recommend starting with [GPT-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5) for complex tasks.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
