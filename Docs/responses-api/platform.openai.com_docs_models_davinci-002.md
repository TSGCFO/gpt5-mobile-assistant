GPT base models can understand and generate natural language or code but are not trained with instruction following. These models are made to be replacements for our original GPT-3 base models and use the legacy Completions API. Most customers should use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
