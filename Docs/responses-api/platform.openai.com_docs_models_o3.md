o3 is a well-rounded and powerful model across domains. It sets a new
standard for math, science, coding, and visual reasoning tasks. It also
excels at technical writing and instruction-following. Use it to think
through multi-step problems that involve analysis across text, code, and images.

o3 is succeeded by [GPT-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5).

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
