`gpt-oss-20b` is our medium-sized open-weight model for low latency, local, or
specialized use-cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters).

[Download gpt-oss-20b on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b).

**Key features**

- **Permissive Apache 2.0 license:** Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent riskâ€”ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.
- **Configurable reasoning effort:** Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.
- **Full chain-of-thought:** Gain complete access to the model's reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs.
- **Fine-tunable:** Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.
- **Agentic capabilities:** Use the models' native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, Python code execution, and structured outputs.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
