Text

text-embedding-ada-002 is our improved, more performant version of our ada embedding model.
Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relatedness between two pieces of text.
Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks.

Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there's a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
