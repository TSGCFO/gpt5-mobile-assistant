A high-quality 3D-rendered illustration of a color wheel logo. The design features eight symmetrical, petal-shaped leaves arranged in a perfect circular flower pattern. Each leaf is semi-transparent like colored glass, rendered in soft pastel tones including pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The petals overlap slightly, creating gentle blended hues where they intersect. The background is a flat, light-toned surface with even, diffused lighting, giving the image a modern, polished, and professional appearance. No text.

In a sprawling ancient forest illuminated by the golden hues of a low-hanging twilight sun, a wide clearing opens into a surreal dreamscape that seems to blend fantasy and forgotten mythology. At the heart of this clearing stands an enormous, weathered tree with a trunk as wide as a small house and bark etched with glowing, ancient runes pulsating faintly in shades of aquamarine and violet. The tree’s branches stretch skyward like arms, covered in bioluminescent leaves that shimmer in a gradient of emerald green to sapphire blue, flickering gently as if breathing with the rhythm of the earth itself. Around the base of the tree lies a circular pool of crystalline water, unnaturally still, reflecting not just the tree above it, but also constellations that don’t exist in our sky—stars shaped like animals, celestial figures, and mysterious glyphs. A narrow stone path, cracked and overgrown with moss and delicate glowing fungi, leads from the edge of the forest to the pool, lined with floating lanterns suspended in midair without any visible support, each encasing a softly glowing flame of a different color. Along the edges of the forest clearing, the trees seem to lean inward, their trunks twisted like ancient dancers, and their leaves whispering secrets in a wind that can be heard but not felt. Tall stalks of silvery grass sway under the influence of a phantom breeze, and clusters of flowers with translucent petals release faint motes of light into the air, like floating pollen that sparkles and twirls as it rises upward. To the right of the tree, a grand stone arch partially buried in vines stands like a portal, its frame adorned with sculpted reliefs of mythical creatures: winged wolves, twin-tailed phoenixes, and enormous turtles with cities on their backs. Beyond the arch shimmers a misty threshold, behind which lies the suggestion of an entirely different realm—its colors slightly more saturated, its sky a strange teal hue with three moons visible in the clouds. A lone traveler stands before this arch, cloaked in flowing robes of deep indigo lined with stardust thread, their hood down to reveal glowing eyes that mirror the reflection in the pool. They carry a long, ornate staff, topped with a cluster of floating crystals that orbit one another slowly, humming with magic. Ahead of the traveler is a small floating companion creature, resembling a cross between a jellyfish and a hummingbird, with translucent wings and tendrils that pulse in rhythm with the traveler’s heartbeat. In the sky above, the clouds swirl in painterly strokes of lavender and peach, pierced occasionally by rays of sunlight that look more like golden waterfalls descending from the heavens. Several large, floating islands drift lazily through the air, each one covered in its own miniature ecosystem: one holds a temple ruin with hanging gardens spilling over its cliffs, another is blanketed in snow and ice with a glowing aurora snaking above it, and yet another contains a small lake with inverted waterfalls that flow upward into the sky. Flocks of gigantic birds with opalescent feathers circle around these islands, their wings leaving shimmering trails behind them as if tearing through the fabric of reality. Occasionally, one can spot a flying whale in the distance, its skin like polished stone, adorned with runes that light up when it sings its deep, resonant song that echoes through the clouds. Closer to the ground, mythical animals roam freely. A unicorn made of mist sips from the crystal pool, its reflection showing a completely different creature—a shadowy stag with fiery antlers. Nearby, a fox with an ethereal tail lounges atop a moss-covered rock, each tail flickering with a different element—flame, water, ice, lightning, smoke, shadow, wind, light, and crystal. Mushrooms with tiny eyes peek from under leaves, while trees occasionally blink as if watching the scene unfold. A choir of unseen voices hums an otherworldly melody that resonates with the air, causing particles of light to float upward in gentle spirals, like visualized sound. In the background, barely visible beyond the treeline, towers rise in the distance, seemingly grown from the land rather than built—crystalline spires twisted like seashells, glowing from within and surrounded by spiraling rings of floating stone. Between them, serpentine dragons fly in lazy arcs, their scales reflecting the shifting colors of the sky, and their breath leaving trails of fog in the air. Every few moments, a ripple of magic pulses through the land, subtly shifting the hues and lighting of the entire environment, as if the world is being constantly re-rendered in real time by an unseen painter. This entire scene exists in a liminal space—neither day nor night, neither real nor imagined, a fusion of the magical and the natural, the fantastical and the familiar. The palette of the image should include deeply saturated jewel tones for the magical elements—sapphire, emerald, amethyst, and ruby—while the natural elements lean toward warm dusk tones—burnished orange, soft pink, and rich earth brown. The overall composition should feel painterly yet hyper-detailed, with textures that could be touched and lighting that changes dynamically across the image, creating depth, contrast, and a sense of wonder. Everything should feel alive: light sources flicker and shift, plants gently sway, and magical energy crackles faintly in the air.

## Overview

The OpenAI API lets you generate and edit images from text prompts, using the GPT Image or DALL·E models. You can access image generation capabilities through two APIs:

### Image API

The [Image API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images) provides three endpoints, each with distinct capabilities:

- **Generations**: [Generate images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#generate-images) from scratch based on a text prompt
- **Edits**: [Modify existing images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#edit-images) using a new prompt, either partially or entirely
- **Variations**: [Generate variations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#image-variations) of an existing image (available with DALL·E 2 only)

This API supports `gpt-image-1` as well as `dall-e-2` and `dall-e-3`.

### Responses API

The [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create#responses-create-tools) allows you to generate images as part of conversations or multi-step flows. It supports image generation as a [built-in tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses), and accepts image inputs and outputs within context.

Compared to the Image API, it adds:

- **Multi-turn editing**: Iteratively make high fidelity edits to images with prompting
- **Flexible inputs**: Accept image [File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) IDs as input images, not just bytes

The image generation tool in responses only supports `gpt-image-1`. For a list of mainline models that support calling this tool, refer to the [supported models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#supported-models) below.

### Choosing the right API

- If you only need to generate or edit a single image from one prompt, the Image API is your best choice.
- If you want to build conversational, editable image experiences with GPT Image, go with the Responses API.

Both APIs let you [customize output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#customize-image-output) — adjust quality, size, format, compression, and enable transparent backgrounds.

### Model comparison

Our latest and most advanced model for image generation is `gpt-image-1`, a natively multimodal language model.

We recommend this model for its high-quality image generation and ability to use world knowledge in image creation. However, you can also use specialized image generation models—DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3—with the Image API.

| Model | Endpoints | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DALL·E 2 | Image API: Generations, Edits, Variations | Lower cost, concurrent requests, inpainting (image editing with a mask) |
| DALL·E 3 | Image API: Generations only | Higher image quality than DALL·E 2, support for larger resolutions |
| GPT Image | Image API: Generations, Edits – Responses API support coming soon | Superior instruction following, text rendering, detailed editing, real-world knowledge |

This guide focuses on GPT Image, but you can also switch to the docs for [DALL·E 2](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=dall-e-2) and [DALL·E 3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=dall-e-3).

To ensure this model is used responsibly, you may need to complete the [API\\
Organization\\
Verification](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification)
from your [developer\\
console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) before using
`gpt-image-1`.

## Generate Images

You can use the [image generation endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create) to create images based on text prompts, or the [image generation tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses) in the Responses API to generate images as part of a conversation.

To learn more about customizing the output (size, quality, format, transparency), refer to the [customize image output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#customize-image-output) section below.

You can set the `n` parameter to generate multiple images at once in a single request (by default, the API returns a single image).

### Multi-turn image generation

With the Responses API, you can build multi-turn conversations involving image generation either by providing image generation calls outputs within context (you can also just use the image ID), or by using the [`previous_response_id` parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=responses#openai-apis-for-conversation-state).
This makes it easy to iterate on images across multiple turns—refining prompts, applying new instructions, and evolving the visual output as the conversation progresses.

### Streaming

The Responses API and Image API support streaming image generation. This allows you to stream partial images as they are generated, providing a more interactive experience.

You can adjust the `partial_images` parameter to receive 0-3 partial images.

- If you set `partial_images` to 0, you will only receive the final image.
- For values larger than zero, you may not receive the full number of partial images you requested if the full image is generated more quickly.

Prompt: Draw a gorgeous image of a river made of white owl feathers, snaking its way
through a serene winter landscape

### Revised prompt

When using the image generation tool in the Responses API, the mainline model (e.g. `gpt-4.1`) will automatically revise your prompt for improved performance.

You can access the revised prompt in the `revised_prompt` field of the image generation call:

```json
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
{
    "id": "ig_123",
    "type": "image_generation_call",
    "status": "completed",
    "revised_prompt": "A gray tabby cat hugging an otter. The otter is wearing an orange scarf. Both animals are cute and friendly, depicted in a warm, heartwarming style.",
    "result": "..."
}
```

## Edit Images

The [image edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/createEdit) endpoint lets you:

- Edit existing images
- Generate new images using other images as a reference
- Edit parts of an image by uploading an image and mask indicating which areas should be replaced (a process known as **inpainting**)

### Create a new image using image references

You can use one or more images as a reference to generate a new image.

In this example, we'll use 4 input images to generate a new image of a gift basket containing the items in the reference images.

Responses APIImage API

Responses API

With the Responses API, you can provide input images in 2 different ways:

- By providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL
- By providing a file ID (created with the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files))

We're actively working on supporting fully qualified URLs to image files as input as well.

### Edit an image using a mask (inpainting)

You can provide a mask to indicate which part of the image should be edited.

When using a mask with GPT Image, additional instructions are sent to the model to help guide the editing process accordingly.

Unlike with DALL·E 2, masking with GPT Image is entirely prompt-based. This means the
model uses the mask as guidance, but may not follow its exact shape with complete
precision.

If you provide multiple input images, the mask will be applied to the first image.

Prompt: a sunlit indoor lounge area with a pool containing a flamingo

#### Mask requirements

The image to edit and mask must be of the same format and size (less than 50MB in size).

The mask image must also contain an alpha channel. If you're using an image editing tool to create the mask, make sure to save the mask with an alpha channel.

Add an alpha channel to a black and white mask

You can modify a black and white image programmatically to add an alpha channel.

from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# 1. Load your black & white mask as a grayscale image
mask = Image.open(img_path_mask).convert("L")

# 2. Convert it to RGBA so it has space for an alpha channel
mask_rgba = mask.convert("RGBA")

# 3. Then use the mask itself to fill that alpha channel
mask_rgba.putalpha(mask)

# 4. Convert the mask into bytes
buf = BytesIO()
mask_rgba.save(buf, format="PNG")
mask_bytes = buf.getvalue()

# 5. Save the resulting file
img_path_mask_alpha = "mask_alpha.png"
with open(img_path_mask_alpha, "wb") as f:
    f.write(mask_bytes)
```

### Input fidelity

The `gpt-image-1` model supports high input fidelity, which allows you to better preserve details from the input images in the output.
This is especially useful when using images that contain elements like faces or logos that require accurate preservation in the generated image.

You can provide multiple input images that will all be preserved with high fidelity, but keep in mind that the first image will be preserved with richer textures and finer details, so if you include elements such as faces, consider placing them in the first image.

To enable high input fidelity, set the `input_fidelity` parameter to `high`. The default value is `low`.

per request. To understand the costs implications, refer to our [vision\\
costs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=responses#calculating-costs) section.

## Customize Image Output

You can configure the following output options:

- **Size**: Image dimensions (e.g., `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`)
- **Quality**: Rendering quality (e.g. `low`, `medium`, `high`)
- **Format**: File output format
- **Compression**: Compression level (0-100%) for JPEG and WebP formats
- **Background**: Transparent or opaque

`size`, `quality`, and `background` support the `auto` option, where the model will automatically select the best option based on the prompt.

### Size and quality options

Square images with standard quality are the fastest to generate. The default size is 1024x1024 pixels.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Available sizes | - `1024x1024` (square) - `1536x1024` (landscape) - `1024x1536` (portrait)<br>- `auto` (default) |
| Quality options | \- `low` \- `medium` \- `high` \- `auto` (default) |

### Output format

The Image API returns base64-encoded image data.
The default format is `png`, but you can also request `jpeg` or `webp`.

If using `jpeg` or `webp`, you can also specify the `output_compression` parameter to control the compression level (0-100%). For example, `output_compression=50` will compress the image by 50%.

Using `jpeg` is faster than `png`, so you should prioritize this format if latency is
a concern.

### Transparency

The `gpt-image-1` model supports transparent backgrounds.
To enable transparency, set the `background` parameter to `transparent`.

It is only supported with the `png` and `webp` output formats.

Transparency works best when setting the quality to `medium` or `high`.

## Limitations

The GPT Image 1 model is a powerful and versatile image generation model, but it still has some limitations to be aware of:

- **Latency:** Complex prompts may take up to 2 minutes to process.
- **Text Rendering:** Although significantly improved over the DALL·E series, the model can still struggle with precise text placement and clarity.
- **Consistency:** While capable of producing consistent imagery, the model may occasionally struggle to maintain visual consistency for recurring characters or brand elements across multiple generations.
- **Composition Control:** Despite improved instruction following, the model may have difficulty placing elements precisely in structured or layout-sensitive compositions.

### Content Moderation

All prompts and generated images are filtered in accordance with our [content policy](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/).

For image generation using `gpt-image-1`, you can control moderation strictness with the `moderation` parameter. This parameter supports two values:

- `auto` (default): Standard filtering that seeks to limit creating certain categories of potentially age-inappropriate content.
- `low`: Less restrictive filtering.

### Supported models

When using image generation in the Responses API, most modern models starting with `gpt-4o` and newer should support the image generation tool. [Check the model detail page for your model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to confirm if your desired model can use the image generation tool.

## Cost and latency

This model generates images by first producing specialized image tokens. Both latency and eventual cost are proportional to the number of tokens required to render an image—larger image sizes and higher quality settings result in more tokens.

The number of tokens generated depends on image dimensions and quality:

| Quality | Square (1024×1024) | Portrait (1024×1536) | Landscape (1536×1024) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 272 tokens | 408 tokens | 400 tokens |
| Medium | 1056 tokens | 1584 tokens | 1568 tokens |
| High | 4160 tokens | 6240 tokens | 6208 tokens |

Note that you will also need to account for [input tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=responses#calculating-costs): text tokens for the prompt and image tokens for the input images if editing images.
If you are using high input fidelity, the number of input tokens will be higher.

Refer to our [pricing page](https://platform.openai.com/pricing#image-generation) for more information about price per text and image tokens.

So the final cost is the sum of:

- input text tokens
- input image tokens if using the edits endpoint
- image output tokens

### Partial images cost

If you want to [stream image generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation#streaming) using the `partial_images` parameter, each partial image will incur an additional 100 image output tokens.
