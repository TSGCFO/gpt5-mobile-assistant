Recipe Generation

GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is our versatile, high-intelligence flagship model.
It accepts both text and image inputs, and produces text outputs (including Structured Outputs).
It is the best model for most tasks, and is our most capable model outside of our o-series models.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
