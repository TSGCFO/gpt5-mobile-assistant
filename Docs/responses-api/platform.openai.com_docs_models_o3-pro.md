The o-series of models are trained with reinforcement learning to think
before they answer and perform complex reasoning. The o3-pro model uses more
compute to think harder and provide consistently better answers.

o3-pro is available in the [Responses API only](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)
to enable support for multi-turn model interactions before responding to API
requests, and other advanced API features in the future. Since o3-pro is designed
to tackle tough problems, some requests may take several minutes to finish.
To avoid timeouts, try using [background mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background).

Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there's a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| Tier 1 | 500 | 30,000 | 90,000 |
