The o1 series of models are trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. o1 models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
