GPT-4o mini (“o” for “omni”) is a fast, affordable small model for focused tasks.
It accepts both text and image inputs, and produces text outputs (including Structured Outputs).
It is ideal for fine-tuning, and model outputs from a larger model like GPT-4o can be distilled to GPT-4o-mini to produce similar results at lower cost and latency.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
