DALL·E is an AI system that creates realistic images and art from a natural language description. DALL·E 3 currently supports the ability, given a prompt, to create a new image with a specific size.

Pricing

Pricing is based on the number of tokens used. For tool-specific models, like search and computer use, there's a fee per tool call. See details in the [pricing page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| Tier | RPM |
| --- | --- |
| Free | Not supported |
| Tier 1 | 500 img/min |
| Tier 2 | 2500 img/min |
| Tier 3 | 5000 img/min |
| Tier 4 | 7500 img/min |
| Tier 5 | 10000 img/min |
