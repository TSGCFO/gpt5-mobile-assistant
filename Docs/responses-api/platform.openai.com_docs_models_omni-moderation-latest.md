Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 250 | 5,000 | 10,000 |
| Tier 1 | 500 | 10,000 | 10,000 |
