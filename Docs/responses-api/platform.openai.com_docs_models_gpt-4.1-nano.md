GPT-4.1 nano excels at instruction following and tool calling. It features a
1M token context window, and low latency without a reasoning step.

Note that we recommend starting with [GPT-5 nano](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-nano) for
more complex tasks.

Rate limits

Rate limits ensure fair and reliable access to the API by placing specific caps on requests or tokens used within a given time period. Your usage tier determines how high these limits are set and automatically increases as you send more requests and spend more on the API.
