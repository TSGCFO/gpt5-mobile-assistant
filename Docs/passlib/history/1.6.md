# Passlib 1.6 [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#passlib-1-6 "Permalink to this headline")

## **1.6.5** (2015-08-04) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id1 "Permalink to this headline")

> Fixed some minor bugs in the test suite which were causing erroneous test failures
> ( [issue 57](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/57) and [issue 58](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/58)). The passlib library itself is unchanged.

## **1.6.4** (2015-07-25) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id2 "Permalink to this headline")

> This release rolls up assorted bug & compatibility fixes since 1.6.2.

### Bugfixes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#bugfixes "Permalink to this headline")

> - Correctly detect bcrypt 2.0. Previous releases were incorrectly detecting it as py-bcrypt,
> causing spurious errors ( [issue 56](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/56)).
> - CryptContext now accepts scheme names as unicode ( [issue 54](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/54)).
> - [`passlib.ext.django`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.ext.django.html#module-passlib.ext.django "passlib.ext.django") now works correctly with Django 1.7-1.8. Previous
> releases had various test failures ( [issue 52](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/52)).
> - [`passlib.apache.HtpasswdFile`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.apache.html#passlib.apache.HtpasswdFile "passlib.apache.HtpasswdFile") now recognizes bcrypt, sha256\_crypt, sha512\_crypt
> hashes ( [issue 55](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/55)).

### BCrypt Changes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#bcrypt-changes "Permalink to this headline")

> A few changes have been made to the [`bcrypt`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html#passlib.hash.bcrypt "passlib.hash.bcrypt") hash:
>
> - It now supports the `$2b$` hash format.
> - It will now issue a [`PasslibSecurityWarning`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityWarning "passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityWarning") if the active backend
> is vulnerable to the [wraparound bug](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html#bsd-wraparound-bug),
> and automatically enable a workaround (py-bcrypt is known to be vulnerable as of v0.4).
> - It will throw a [`PasslibSecurityError`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityError "passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityError") if the active backend
> is vulnerable to the [8-bit bug](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html#crypt-blowfish-bug) (none of Passlib’s
> backends are known to be vulnerable as of 2015-07).
> - Updated documentation to indicate the cffi-based [bcrypt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcrypt)
> library is now the recommended bcrypt backend.
> - Backend capability detection code refactored to rely on runtime detection
> rather than hardcoded information.

### Other Changes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#other-changes "Permalink to this headline")

> - Source repo’s `tox.ini` updated. Now assumes python3 by default, and refactored test
> environments to more cleanly delineate the different setups being tested.
> - Passlib releases are now published as wheels instead of eggs.

## **1.6.3** (2015-07-25) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id3 "Permalink to this headline")

> This was relabeled as **1.6.4** due to PyPI upload issues.

## **1.6.2** (2013-12-26) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id4 "Permalink to this headline")

> Minor changes & compatibility fixes
>
> - Re-tuned the [`default_rounds`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.ifc.html#passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.default_rounds "passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.default_rounds") values for all of the hashes.
> - Added the new [bcrypt\_sha256](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt_sha256.html) hash,
> which wraps BCrypt using SHA256 in order to work around BCrypt’s password size limitations
> ( [issue 43](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/43)).
> - [passlib.hash.bcrypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html):
> Added support for the [bcrypt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcrypt)
> library as one of the possible bcrypt backends that will be used if available.
> ( [issue 49](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/49))
> - [`passlib.ext.django`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.ext.django.html#module-passlib.ext.django "passlib.ext.django"): Passlib’s Django extension
> (and it’s related hashes and unittests) have been updated to handle
> some minor API changes in Django 1.5-1.6. They should now be compatible with Django 1.2 and up.
> ( [issue 50](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/50))

## **1.6.1** (2012-08-02) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id6 "Permalink to this headline")

> Minor bugfix release
>
> - _bugfix_: Various [`CryptContext`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptContext "passlib.context.CryptContext") methods
> would incorrectly raise [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "(in Python v3.9)") if passed a `unicode`
> user category under Python 2. For consistency,
> `unicode` user category values are now encoded to `utf-8` [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "(in Python v3.9)") under Python 2.
>
> - _bugfix_: Reworked internals of the `CryptContext` config compiler
> to fix a couple of border cases ( [issue 39](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/39)):
>
>
> > - It will now throw a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.9)")
> > if the [default](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-default-option) scheme is marked as
> > [deprecated](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-deprecated-option).
> > - If no default scheme is specified, it will use the first
> > _non-deprecated_ scheme.
> > - Finally, it will now throw a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.9)") if all schemes
> > are marked as deprecated.
>
> - _bugfix_: FreeBSD 8.3 added native support for [`sha256_crypt`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.sha256_crypt.html#passlib.hash.sha256_crypt "passlib.hash.sha256_crypt") –
> updated Passlib’s unittests and documentation accordingly ( [issue 35](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/35)).
>
> - _bugfix:_ Fixed bug which caused some `passlib.apache` unittests to fail
> if mtime resolution >= 1 second ( [issue 35](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/35)).
>
> - _bugfix:_ Fixed minor bug in `passlib.registry`, should now work correctly under Python 3.3.
>
> - Various documentation updates and corrections.

## **1.6.0** (2012-05-01) [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id7 "Permalink to this headline")

### Overview [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#overview "Permalink to this headline")

> Welcome to Passlib 1.6.
>
> The main goal of this release was to clean up the codebase, tighten input
> validation, and simplify the publically exposed interfaces. This release also
> brings a number of other improvements: 10 or so new hash algorithms,
> additional security precautions for the existing algorithms,
> a number of speed improvements, and updated documentation.

#### Deprecated APIs [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#deprecated-apis "Permalink to this headline")

> In order to improve the publically exposed interface,
> some of the more cumbersome and less-used functions in Passlib
> have been deprecated / renamed. This should not affect 99% of applications.
> That said, all the deprecated interfaces are still present, and will continue
> to be supported for at least one more major release.
> To help with migration, all deprecated functions should issue an informative
> [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "(in Python v3.9)") when they are invoked, detailing their suggested replacement.
> The following interfaces have changed:
>
> - The semi-internal `CryptPolicy` class has been deprecated
> in its entirety. All functionality has been rolled into the
> parent `CryptContext` class (see [below](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html#crypt-policy-deprecated) for more).
> - The interface of the [`passlib.apache`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.apache.html#module-passlib.apache "passlib.apache: reading/writing htpasswd & htdigest files") classes has been improved:
> some confusing methods and options have been renamed, some new
> constructors and other functions have been added.
> - The (undocumented) `passlib.win32` module has been deprecated,
> all of its functionality is now offered through the
> [lmhash](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.lmhash.html) and [nthash](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.nthash.html)
> algorithms.

### New Hashes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#new-hashes "Permalink to this headline")

> The release adds support for a number of hash algorithms:
>
> [cisco\_pix](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.cisco_pix.html), [cisco\_type7](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.cisco_type7.html)Two hash formats frequently found on various
> Cisco devices _(for Cisco Type 5 hashes, see_ [md5\_crypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.md5_crypt.html) _)._[django\_pbkdf2\_sha256](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.django_std.html#django-1-4-hashes), [django\_pbkdf2\_sha1](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.django_std.html#django-1-4-hashes), [django\_bcrypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.django_std.html#django-1-4-hashes)All three of the new hash schemes introduced in Django 1.4.[lmhash](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.lmhash.html), [nthash](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.nthash.html)Microsoft’s legacy “Lan Manager” hash, and the replacement
> NT password hash. _(the old_ `nthash` _algorithm in Passlib 1.5 has been renamed to_ [`bsd_nthash`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.nthash.html#passlib.hash.bsd_nthash "passlib.hash.bsd_nthash") _, to reflect its lineage)_.[msdcc](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.msdcc.html), [msdcc2](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.msdcc2.html)Microsoft Windows’ Domain Cached Credentials, versions 1 and 2.
> These algorithms also go by the names “DCC”, “MSCache”, and “MSCash”.[mssql2000](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.mssql2000.html), [mssql2005](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.mssql2005.html)Hash algorithms used by MS SQL Server 2000 and later.[scram](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.scram.html)A hash format added specifically for storing the complex digest
> information needed to authenticate a user via the SCRAM protocol
> ( [**RFC 5802**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802.html)). It can also be used in the same way as any other
> password hash in Passlib.

### Existing Hashes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#existing-hashes "Permalink to this headline")

> Additionally, the following new features have been added to the existing hashes:
>
> _Password Size Limit_
>
> All hashes in Passlib will now throw [`PasswordSizeError`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasswordSizeError "passlib.exc.PasswordSizeError")
> if handed a password that’s larger than 4096 characters.
>
> This limit should be larger than any reasonable password size,
> and prevents various things including DOS abuses, and exploitation
> of OSes with a buggy `crypt()` implementation.
> See [`PasswordSizeError`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasswordSizeError "passlib.exc.PasswordSizeError") for how to change this limit.
>
> _Constant Time Comparison_
>
> All hash comparisons in Passlib now use the “constant time” [\[1\]](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html#consteq)
> comparison function [`consteq()`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.html#passlib.utils.consteq "passlib.utils.consteq"), instead
> of `==`.
>
> This change is motivated a well-known [hmac timing attack](http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/)
> which exploits short-circuit string comparisons.
> While this attack is not currently feasible against
> most password hashes, some of the weaker unsalted
> hashes supported by Passlib may be vulnerable; and this
> change has been made preventatively to all of them.
>
> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | [\[1\]](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html#id8) | “constant time” is a misnomer, it actually takes `THETA(len(righthand_value))` time. |
>
> _Strict Parameters_
>
> Previous releases of Passlib would silently correct any invalid values
> (such as `rounds` parameters that were out of range). This is was deemed
> undesirable, as it leaves developers unaware they are requesting
> an incorrect (and potentially insecure) value.
>
> Starting with this release, providing invalid values to
> [`PasswordHash.encrypt`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.ifc.html#passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.encrypt "passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.encrypt")
> will result in a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.9)"). However, most hashes now accept
> an optional `relaxed=True` keyword, which causes Passlib
> to try and correct invalid values, and if successful,
> issue a [`PasslibHashWarning`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasslibHashWarning "passlib.exc.PasslibHashWarning") instead.
> These warnings can then be filtered if desired.
>
> [bcrypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html)
>
> The BCrypt hash now supports the [crypt\_blowfish](http://www.openwall.com/crypt/) project’s
> `$2y$` hash prefix.
>
> On an unrelated note, Passlib now offers an (experimental) pure-python
> implementation of BCrypt. Unfortunately, it’s still _WAY_ too slow to be
> suitable for production use; and is disabled by default.
> If you really need it, see the BCrypt [documentation](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt.html#bcrypt-backends)
> for how to enable it.
>
> [bsdi\_crypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.bsdi_crypt.html)BSDi-Crypt will now issue a [`PasslibSecurityWarning`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.exc.html#passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityWarning "passlib.exc.PasslibSecurityWarning")
> if an application requests an even number of rounds, due to
> a known weakness in DES. Existing hashes with an even number of rounds will
> now be flagged by [`CryptContext.needs_update()`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptContext.needs_update "passlib.context.CryptContext.needs_update").[ldap\_salted\_{digest}](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.ldap_std.html)The LDAP salted digests now support salts of any size
> from 4-16 bytes, though they still default to 4 ( [issue 30](https://foss.heptapod.net/python-libs/passlib/issues/30)).[md5\_crypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.md5_crypt.html), [sha256\_crypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.md5_crypt.html), [sha512\_crypt](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.md5_crypt.html)The builtin implementation of these hashes has been
> sped up by about 25%, using an additional pre-computation step.[unix\_disabled](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.unix_disabled.html)
>
> The `unix_fallback` handler has been deprecated,
> and will be removed in Passlib 1.8.
> Applications should use the stricter-but-equivalent
> `unix_disabled` handler instead.
>
> This most likely only affects internal Passlib code.

### CryptContext [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#cryptcontext "Permalink to this headline")

> The [CryptContext](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-reference) class has had a thorough
> internal overhaul. While the primary interface has not changed
> at all, the internals are much stricter about input validation,
> common methods have shorter code-paths, and the
> construction and introspection of `CryptContext` objects
> has been greatly simplified.
> Changes include:
>
> - All new (and hopefully clearer) [tutorial](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/narr/context-tutorial.html#context-tutorial)
> and [reference](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-reference) documentation.
>
> - The [`CryptPolicy`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptPolicy "passlib.context.CryptPolicy") class and the `CryptContext.policy` attribute have been deprecated.
>
> This was a semi-internal class, which most applications
> were not involved with at all, but to be conservative about
> breaking things, the existing CryptPolicy interface
> will remain in-place and supported until Passlib 1.8.
>
> All of the functionality of this class has been rolled into
> `CryptContext` itself, so there’s one less class to remember.
> Many of the methods provided by `CryptPolicy` are now
> `CryptContext` methods, most with the same name and call syntax.
> Information on migrating existing code can be found in
> the deprecation warnings issued by the class itself,
> and in the [`CryptPolicy`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptPolicy "passlib.context.CryptPolicy") documentation.
>
> - Two new class constructors have been added ( [`CryptContext.from_path()`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptContext.from_path "passlib.context.CryptContext.from_path")
> and [`CryptContext.from_string()`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptContext.from_string "passlib.context.CryptContext.from_string")) to aid in loading CryptContext objects
> directly from a configuration file.
>
> - The [deprecated](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-deprecated-option) keyword
> can now be set to the special string `"auto"`; which will
> automatically deprecate all schemes except for the default one.
>
> - The [min\_verify\_time](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#context-min-verify-time-option) keyword
> has been deprecated, will be ignored in release 1.7, and will be removed in release 1.8.
> It was never very useful, and now complicates the internal code needlessly.
>
> - All string parsing now uses stdlib’s `SafeConfigParser`.
>
> Previous releases used the original `ConfigParser` interpolation;
> which was deprecated in Passlib 1.5, and has now been removed.
> This should only affect strings which contained raw `%` characters,
> they will now need to be escaped via `%%`.

### Other Modules [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#other-modules "Permalink to this headline")

> - The api for the [`passlib.apache`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.apache.html#module-passlib.apache "passlib.apache: reading/writing htpasswd & htdigest files") module has been updated
> to add more flexibility, and to fix some ambiguous method
> and keyword names. The old interface is still supported, but deprecated,
> and will be removed in Passlib 1.8.
> - Added the [`django14_context`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.apps.html#passlib.apps.django14_context "passlib.apps.django14_context") preset to the
> the `passlib.apps` module. this preconfigured CryptContext
> object should support all the hashes found in a typical Django 1.4
> deployment.
> - **new**: Added [`passlib.ext.django`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.ext.django.html#module-passlib.ext.django "passlib.ext.django"), a Django plugin which can be used to
> override Django’s password hashing framework with a custom Passlib
> policy (an undocumented beta version of this was present in the 1.5 release).
> - **new**: The [`passlib.utils.saslprep()`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.html#passlib.utils.saslprep "passlib.utils.saslprep") function may be useful
> for applications which need to normalize the unicode representation
> of passwords before they are hashed.

### Bugfixes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#id9 "Permalink to this headline")

> - Handle platform-specific error strings that may be returned by the
> `crypt()` methods of some OSes.
> - Fixed rare `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'`
> error that sometimes occurred on platforms with a deviant implementation
> of `crypt()`.

### Internal Changes [¶](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history/1.6.html\#internal-changes "Permalink to this headline")

> _The following changes should not affect most end users,_
> _and have been documented just to keep track of them:_
>
> - Passlib is now source-compatible with Python 2.5+ and Python 3.x.
> It no longer requires the use of the **2to3** command
> to translate it for Python 3.
>
> - The unittest suite has been rewritten. It handles a number of additional
> border cases, enforcing uniform behavior across all hashes, and
> even features the addition of some simplistic fuzz testing.
> It will take a bit longer to run though. While not perfect,
> statement coverage is at about 95%.
> Additionally, the hash test suite has been enhanced with many more
> test vectors across the board, including 8-bit test vectors.
>
> - The internal framework used to construct the hash classes ( [`passlib.utils.handlers`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.handlers.html#module-passlib.utils.handlers "passlib.utils.handlers: framework for writing password hashes"))
> was rewritten drastically. The new version provides stricter input checking,
> reduction in boilerplate code. _These changes should not affect any_
> _publically exposed routines_.
>
>
> > - [`GenericHandler`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.handlers.html#passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler "passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler")’s
> > `strict` keyword was removed, `strict=True` is now
> > the class’s default behavior: all values must be specified,
> > and be within the correct bounds. The new keywords
> > `use_defaults` and `relaxed` can be used to disable
> > these two requirements.
> > - Most of the private methods of [`GenericHandler`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.handlers.html#passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler "passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler")
> > were renamed to begin with an underscore, to clarify their status;
> > and turned into instance methods, to simplify the internals.
> > (for example, `norm_salt` was renamed to `_norm_salt`).
> > - [`StaticHandler`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.handlers.html#passlib.utils.handlers.StaticHandler "passlib.utils.handlers.StaticHandler") now derives from
> > `GenericHandler`, and requires `_calc_checksum()` be
> > implemented instead of `encrypt()`. The old style is supported
> > but deprecated, and support will be removed in Passlib 1.8.
> > - Calls to `HasManyBackends.set_backend()`
> > should now use the string `"any"` instead of the value `None`.
> > `None` was deprecated in release 1.5, and is no longer supported.
>
>
> - `passlib.utils.h64` has been replaced by an instance of the
> new [`Base64Engine`](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.utils.binary.html#passlib.utils.binary.Base64Engine "passlib.utils.binary.Base64Engine") class. This instance is
> imported under the same name, and has (mostly) the same interface;
